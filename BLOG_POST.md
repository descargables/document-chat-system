## TL;DR

Today, I'm launching **Document Chat System** - a completely free, open-source platform that lets you upload documents and have intelligent AI conversations with them. Built with Next.js 15, powered by multiple AI providers, and ready to deploy in minutes.

## The Problem

We're drowning in documents. PDFs, Word files, research papers, contracts, manuals, reports - they pile up faster than we can read them. And when we need specific information? We spend hours searching, skimming, and hoping we haven't missed something important.

AI assistants like ChatGPT have shown us a better way - natural language conversations. But there's a catch: they don't know about YOUR documents. Sure, you can copy-paste snippets, but that's manual, tedious, and limited by context windows.

**What if your documents could just... talk to you?**

That's exactly what Document Chat System does. And unlike expensive proprietary solutions, it's completely free, open source, and yours to control.

## What Is Document Chat System?

Document Chat System is a production-ready, open-source platform that combines document management with AI-powered conversational interfaces. Think of it as your personal AI librarian that has read every document you've uploaded and can answer questions about them instantly.

### Key Features

‚úÖ **Multi-Format Support** - PDFs, Word documents, images (with OCR), text files, and more
‚úÖ **Multiple AI Providers** - OpenRouter (100+ models), OpenAI, Anthropic, ImageRouter for image generation
‚úÖ **Semantic Search** - Vector embeddings with Pinecone or pgvector for accurate retrieval
‚úÖ **Multi-Tenant Architecture** - Organizations, teams, role-based access control
‚úÖ **Background Processing** - Inngest for scalable document processing
‚úÖ **Optional Monetization** - Built-in Stripe integration for SaaS deployment
‚úÖ **Self-Hosted** - Deploy anywhere, keep full control of your data
‚úÖ **MIT Licensed** - Use it however you want, commercially or personally

## Why I Built This

Over the past year, I've watched dozens of teams rebuild the same document chat features from scratch. It's a complex problem that requires:

- Document parsing and text extraction
- Vector embeddings and semantic search
- AI provider integration and streaming
- User authentication and multi-tenancy
- File storage and processing pipelines
- Rate limiting and error handling

Each team reinventing the wheel, each facing the same challenges, each spending months on infrastructure instead of their unique value proposition.

I wanted to change that.

**Document Chat System is the foundation I wish I had when I started building AI applications.**

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Knowledge Management
Build searchable knowledge bases, research libraries, and personal "second brains" with AI-powered recall.

**Example:** A consulting firm uploads all their past reports and proposals. New consultants can ask "What approaches have we used for digital transformation projects?" and instantly get relevant insights from years of work.

### 2. Customer Support
Train support teams with product manuals, policies, and FAQs for instant AI-powered answers.

**Example:** A SaaS company uploads their entire documentation. Support agents type customer questions and immediately get accurate answers with source citations.

### 3. Legal & Compliance
Maintain regulatory documents and get instant answers about compliance requirements and policies.

**Example:** A legal team uploads contract templates and compliance documents. They can ask "What are our data retention requirements under GDPR?" and get precise answers with document references.

### 4. Education & Research
Upload textbooks, lecture notes, and research papers for AI-powered tutoring and study assistance.

**Example:** A PhD student uploads 50 research papers. Instead of re-reading everything, they ask "What methodologies have been used to measure user engagement?" and get a synthesized answer across all papers.

### 5. Business Intelligence
Convert reports, presentations, and data exports into a conversational interface for quick insights.

**Example:** An executive team uploads quarterly reports. During meetings, they can ask "What were our Q3 customer acquisition costs compared to Q2?" without digging through spreadsheets.

### 6. White-Label SaaS
Deploy as your own branded document management platform with built-in billing.

**Example:** An agency creates a custom document portal for clients, charges monthly subscription fees, and manages everything under their brand.

## The Technology Behind It: RAG Explained

Document Chat System uses **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** - a technique that combines the power of search with AI generation.

Here's how it works:

### 1. Document Processing
When you upload a document:
- Text is extracted (OCR for images)
- Content is split into manageable chunks
- Metadata is extracted and stored

### 2. Embedding Generation
Each chunk is converted into a **vector embedding** - a mathematical representation of its meaning. Similar content has similar vectors.

### 3. Vector Storage
Embeddings are stored in a vector database (Pinecone or pgvector) for fast similarity search.

### 4. Query Processing
When you ask a question:
- Your question is converted to a vector embedding
- Similar document chunks are retrieved (semantic search)
- Relevant context is sent to the AI model

### 5. AI Response
The AI model generates an answer using:
- Your question
- Retrieved document context
- Its pre-trained knowledge

This ensures answers are **accurate**, **relevant**, and **grounded in your documents**.

## FAQs

### Is my data safe?

**Yes.** You control where your data lives:
- Self-host on your own infrastructure
- Use encrypted file storage (Supabase)
- Data is isolated by organization
- No data is sent to third parties (except AI providers for processing)

### Can I use this commercially?

**Absolutely.** MIT license means no restrictions. Build a SaaS, use it internally, sell it to clients - whatever you need.

### How does it compare to [competitor]?

Most document chat tools are:
- **Expensive** ($50-500/user/month)
- **Closed source** (vendor lock-in)
- **Limited** (specific use cases only)
- **Cloud-only** (can't self-host)

Document Chat System is free, open source, flexible, and self-hostable.

### What AI models can I use?

Currently supported:
- **OpenRouter:** 100+ models (GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Mistral, etc.)
- **OpenAI:** GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5, embeddings
- **Anthropic:** Claude 3 (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- **ImageRouter:** Multiple image generation models

### Can I add my own AI provider?

**Yes!** The adapter pattern makes it easy to add new providers. Check the documentation for a guide.

### Do I need to know how to code?

For basic usage: **No.** Just deploy and use the web interface.

For customization: **Some technical knowledge helps**, but the documentation is beginner-friendly.

### How much does it cost to run?

Depends on usage, but expect:
- **Hobby project:** Free (using free tiers)
- **Small team (5-10 users):** $10-30/month
- **Medium team (50 users):** $50-150/month
- **Large team (200+ users):** $200-500/month

Mostly AI API costs. Infrastructure is often free or cheap.
