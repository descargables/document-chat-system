## Tips for a Great Demo Recording

### Acknowledging Work-in-Progress Features:

**IMPORTANT**: Be transparent about the project's current state!

During the demo, if you encounter:

- **Missing features**: Say "This feature is planned but not yet implemented - this is a great contribution opportunity!"
- **UI rough edges**: Say "The UI is functional but we're looking for designers to help polish it"
- **Performance issues**: Say "We're aware of this and it's on the roadmap - contributions welcome!"
- **Bugs or glitches**: Don't hide them! Say "This is an active development project, and we're working through issues like this. If you know how to fix it, we'd love a PR!"

**Example phrases to use**:

- "This is a work in progress, and we're actively improving it"
- "This area needs some love - perfect opportunity for contributors"
- "We have big plans for this section - check out the roadmap in the GitHub issues"
- "If you have ideas on how to improve this, open an issue or discussion"

### Pacing & Delivery:

- **Speak clearly and at a moderate pace** - viewers can always speed up
- **Pause briefly** after each major action to let viewers process
- **Use transitions**: "Now let's...", "Next, I'll show you...", "Notice how..."
- **Avoid filler words**: "um", "uh", "like", "you know"
- **Be honest and transparent** about what's working and what's not

### Visual Best Practices:

- **Use a cursor highlighter** to make mouse movements visible
- **Zoom in** on important UI elements when explaining them
- **Hide sensitive information**: email addresses, API keys, real document content
- **Use dummy data** for documents if needed
- **Keep animations smooth** - wait for transitions to complete before moving on

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:

- ❌ Talking too fast or too slow
- ❌ Skipping error handling (show how the system handles errors gracefully)
- ❌ Not explaining what's happening during loading states
- ❌ Forgetting to show the "wow" moment (AI responding with accurate answers)
- ❌ Technical jargon overload for non-technical audiences

### What Makes a Demo Compelling:

- ✅ Show a real problem being solved
- ✅ Use realistic documents and questions
- ✅ Demonstrate speed and responsiveness
- ✅ Highlight unique features (BYOK, multi-provider, background processing)
- ✅ Show both simple and complex use cases
- ✅ End with a clear next step for viewers
