### Version 1: Professional/Business Audience

**Subject:** 🚀 Introducing Document Chat System - Open Source AI Document Management

Hi [First Name],

I'm excited to share something I've been working on that I think you'll find valuable.

**Today, I'm launching Document Chat System** - a completely free, open-source platform that transforms how you interact with your documents using AI.

### What is it?

Document Chat System lets you upload any document (PDFs, Word files, images, and more) and have intelligent conversations with them. Ask questions, extract insights, and find information instantly - powered by advanced AI models.

### Why does this matter?

Whether you're:
- **A developer** building AI-powered applications
- **A business leader** managing knowledge bases and documentation
- **An entrepreneur** looking to leverage AI without vendor lock-in
- **A researcher** working with large document collections
- **Anyone** drowning in PDFs and documents

...this tool can save you hours of manual searching and reading.

### What makes it different?

✅ **100% Free & Open Source** - MIT licensed, no hidden costs
✅ **Your Data, Your Control** - Self-host anywhere, no vendor lock-in
✅ **Multiple AI Providers** - Choose from 100+ models via OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, and more
✅ **Enterprise-Ready** - Multi-tenancy, RBAC, vector search, background processing
✅ **Optional Monetization** - Built-in Stripe integration to turn it into your own SaaS

### Version 2: Developer/Technical Audience

**Subject:** 🚀 Just Launched: Document Chat System - Open Source RAG Platform with Next.js 15 & OpenRouter

Hey [First Name],

I just pushed a project live that I think you'll appreciate as a fellow developer.

**Document Chat System** is an open-source, production-ready document management platform with AI-powered chat capabilities. Think of it as a modern RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system you can self-host or white-label.

### The Stack

Built with the latest tech:
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL
- **AI:** OpenRouter (100+ models), OpenAI, ImageRouter for image gen
- **Vector DB:** Pinecone or pgvector for semantic search
- **Infrastructure:** Supabase, Upstash Redis, Inngest, Docker-ready
- **Optional:** Stripe for monetization, Clerk for auth

### Key Features

✅ Multi-provider AI integration (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic)
✅ Advanced document processing (PDF, DOCX, images with OCR)
✅ Vector search with embeddings (RAG implementation)
✅ Multi-tenant architecture with RBAC
✅ Background job processing with Inngest
✅ Type-safe APIs with Zod validation
✅ Production-ready Docker setup
✅ Optional billing/SaaS features built-in

### Why I Built This

I kept seeing developers rebuild the same document chat features over and over. This is my attempt to create a solid foundation that:

1. **Actually works in production** (not just a demo)
2. **Can be monetized** (optional Stripe integration)
3. **Doesn't lock you in** (MIT license, self-hostable)
4. **Uses modern patterns** (Next.js 15, Server Components, streaming)

### Check It Out

### Contribute?

The repo is structured for contributions:
- Issues labeled for good first issues
- Clear architecture and documentation
- Active development and quick PR reviews

Would love your feedback, stars, and contributions if you're interested.

Cheers,

[Your Name]

P.S. - Deploy to Vercel in one click from the README. Takes ~5 minutes with our automated setup script.
